Send written comments to Pike-San Isabel National Forests & Cimarron and Comanche National Grasslands, Supervisor’s Office, Attention: Jason Smith, 2840 Kachina Drive Pueblo, CO 81008.</strong> </p>\n<p>Bassam Guard Station was built in 1911 as one of a network of remote stations to be used by the first forest rangers and guards to monitor grazing sheep and cattle, manage timber harvesting, apprehended poachers, and report fire, road and weather conditions on National Forest lands. This cabin provides visitors with access to many recreation opportunities in the remote back country.</p>\n<h2>Recreation</h2>\n<p>Visitors may wish to take a day trip to the Arkansas River for kayaking, whitewater rafting or fishing. There are many recreational activities on the Salida Ranger District including hiking, biking, horseback riding, and OHV riding on designated forest roads and trails. <br><br>Or take a trip to the historic ghost town of St. Elmo. An old saloon, county courthouse and many other historic structures remain from the days of its mining glory.<br><br> The City of Salida and Town of Buena Vista offer visitor’s unique restaurants,  shops, and art galleries to enjoy.</p>\n<h2>Facilities</h2>\nThe 14 x 16 cabin includes a full-sized bed, dresser, a small table with two chairs, a two-burner propane stove for cooking, and a wood-burning stove for heat. A metal campfire ring and picnic table are onsite. The cabin sleeps two adults, and an additional six adults may camp outside in tents or a camper. The bunkhouse and barn are off-limits to the public.\n  \nHorses may be picketed or corralled outside of the fenced area by the entrance of the cabin site. Portable corrals are permitted, but must be moved every few days to prevent damage to vegetation and soil. \n  \nWater is available at a hand pump, but guests are advised to bring extra drinking water. Limited cooking and dining utensils are provided. Guests should also bring food, matches, toilet paper, flashlights, bedding, garbage bags, and an ax for chopping firewood. Dead and downed wood may be collected and used in campfires and in the wood-burning stove.<h2>Natural Features</h2>\nThe cabin sits in a stand of Aspens at an approximate elevation of 9,700 feet, south of Bassam Ridge. The cabin is within the Salida Ranger District, spanning 440,000 acres of public lands in central Colorado. The Arkansas River valley is known locally as the \"Banana Belt of Colorado\" because of the generally mild temperatures and sunny days. Springtime can be deceptive with sporadic spring snowstorms occurring from March to May. During the summer months, days are warm with cool nights. Afternoon thundershowers are common during July and August. The fall months are are generally dry and sunny with cooler morning temperatures.\n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\nThe cabin is located near the eastern boundary of Browns Canyon National Monument. Explore the monument from the Bassam Park area on foot or mountain bike (trail 1435). Or, for those with high clearance vehicles, take a scenic drive along Aspen Ridge Road (road 185). Note that much of the monument's western side is being managed as a wilderness study area, so motorized vehicles and bicycles are not allowed. \n\n\n\n\n",
        "FacilityDirections": "From Salida travel north on Highway 285 to the junction with Highways 24/285 near Johnson's Village. Turn right onto Hwys 24/285, passing through Johnson's Village.

        "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>\nCongo Gulch is an old Forest Service cabin that allows guests to relax in the outdoors and step back in time to when the cabin was used during bygone gold mining days. It is part of the Fremont Powerhouse complex, a hub for mining built in the early 1900s. As one of four cabins located at the site, the cabin offers flexibility for large groups. Guests can rent all cabins and also pitch tents in the grassy yard. \n  \nThe surrounding valleys once teemed with mining activity, primarily gold. The Fremont Powerhouse was built in 1908 as an economical method for mining. Two dams were constructed at Olive Lake, and water from the lake was piped through an 8-mile wood and steel pipeline to the powerhouse to generate electricity. Homes were constructed to shelter workers who monitored the pipeline. Today, these same shelters are available as recreational rentals.\n  \nCongo Gulch is named for the small creek that runs beside the property. Winter access may require skis, snowshoes or snowmobiles.<h2>Recreation</h2>\nGuests can hike on North Fork John Day Wilderness Area trails or go mountain biking on forest roads. A drive along the Blue Mountain Scenic Byway is a treat, as are activities like huckleberry and mushroom picking, bird watching, wildlife viewing and photographing the vast landscape. Nearby Olive Lake offers boating, fishing and swimming.<h2>Facilities</h2>\n  \nThe two-story white cabin with wood siding and a metal roof can accommodate up to 12 guests. It features:\n· two bedrooms upstairs with dressers, a queen bed, 3 twins, and a full-over-queen bunkbed; \n· one bedroom downstairs with a dresser and full-over-queen bunkbed; \n· parlor with dining table/chairs, 2 futons and end tables; \n· kitchen with refrigerator, electric stove/oven, microwave, coffee pot, toaster, cookware, dishes, and a second dining table with chairs; \n· full bath with shower/tub and flush toilet. \nThe cabin has electric lights and an oil heating stove. A picnic table and brick fireplace are provided next to the pond (bring your own firewood). Cleaning supplies are also provided and renters are required to clean the house before they leave.\nWater is available June through September only. No water or indoor plumbing from October to May. Instead, an outhouse is available for use. In these seasons, guests are asked to bring plenty of water for drinking, cooking and washing. Other items to pack year-round include food, bedding, a first aid kit, flashlight, matches and all other basic camping gear. \nClick here for more cabin details.<h2>Natural Features</h2>\nThe cabin sits at about 5,000 feet in elevation and is neatly tucked under a large Douglas-fir, next to a small pond. A grassy lawn in front spreads to the other three cabins in the area. The forest lies in the Blue Mountains and is home to Ponderosa pine lodgepole pine, larch, and Douglas fir. \n \nBirds in the area include the black-backed woodpecker, American kestrel and the boreal owl. Black bear, cougar, wolves, elk and deer are among the native land mammals. Click here to learn about bear safety.\n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\nThe cabin is located less than six miles from Granite, Oregon, a ghost town that once bustled with prospectors and pioneers. The town provides groceries and fuel. Opportunities for horseback riding and a boat ramp, boating, fishing, and swimming are located within ten miles from the cabin.",

        "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>\nPlatoro Cabin 2 is located downtown in the small mining town of Platoro, Colorado, at an elevation of 10,000 feet in the Rio Grande National Forest.<br/><br/> \n\nThe cabin was built in 1963 as a base quarters for various Forest Service Crews working in the surrounding areas until the early 1990s.<br/><br/>\n\nToday the cabin is a getaway for guests seeking relaxation and recreation in south-central Colorado.\n\n<h2>Recreation</h2>\nThe area around the cabin offers a variety of recreational opportunities year-round. Summertime brings great scenic driving tour opportunities in and around Platoro and Summitville.<br/><br/>\n\nAnglers have a spectacular backdrop when fishing Iron Creek or Treasure Creek. The nearby Platoro Reservoir, which feeds the Conejos River, provides excellent fishing for kokanee salmon, rainbow and brown trout.<br/><br/>\n\nGreat hiking can be found around the area, as it spans both the Rio Grande and San Juan National Forests, as well as the South San Juan Wilderness.<br/><br/> \n\nBig game hunting is popular in fall, while snowmobiling, skiing and snowshoeing are popular winter activities.   <h2>Facilities</h2>\nThe accessible cabin has a combination kitchen/living room, a bedroom and a bathroom. It is furnished with two bunkbeds, with twin beds on the top and pull-out full beds on the bottom, that can accommodate up to six people. It has a heater, stove, refrigerator and lighting, all powered by propane. The kitchen is equipped with a table and chairs and cooking gear and the bathroom has a flush toilet and shower. The cabin has entry ramps and wheelchair accessible facilities in the bathroom and the kitchen.<br/><br/> \n\nAlthough the cabin has most amenities, guests do need to provide their own food, sleeping bags, linens, towels, dish soap, matches, first aid kit, toilet paper and garbage bags. Guests are also encouraged to bring an additional light source in case of emergencies.<br/><br/> \n\nThe town of Platoro has many amenities including a grocery store, rental cabins, a small lodge, outfitter-guide services and horseback rides. <h2>Natural Features</h2>\nPlatoro is a natural and unspoiled destination nestled in the San Juan Mountains of southern Colorado. Platoro started out as a boomtown in the late 1800s following the discovery of large deposits of gold and silver in the area.<br/><br/> \n\nThe nearby San Juan Wilderness is an area defined by peaks and cliffs as well as pinnacles and ridges. The headwaters for the Conejos, San Juan and Blanco Rivers are located here as well. The erosion of rich volcanic rock in combination with heavy snowfall has produced forest ecosystems in the area that transition from lodgepole pine to aspen, then through Engelmann spruce and subalpine fir to alpine tundra.\n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\nSummitville, Colorado, is a nearby ghost town where gold was first discovered in 1870, then mined until the early 1990s. ",
        "FacilityDirections": "From Antonito, CO, follow Highway 17 west to its junction with FSR 250.  Follow FSR 250 northwest up the Conejos Canyon about 22 miles to Platoro. Turn left on FSR 250.6A and follow it .2 mile to the cabin.<br/><br/>\n\nFrom the town of South Fork follow Highway 160 southwest for about 7.5 miles. Turn left onto Park Creek Road which is also Forest Service Road 380. Continue for approximately 27 miles, paralleling Park Creek for much of the way. Turn right, crossing the Alamosa River, and follow National Forest Road 250 over Stunner pass and into the town of Platoro. This stretch of the trip is about 6 miles long. The cabins are located on the southeast part of town. It is best to cross the Conejos River using the lower bridge; this is National Forest Road 250.6A. Continue on this road for about .2 miles to the cabins. The cabins are easily identified by their yellow and brown siding and trim, as well as by the Forest Service signs.<br/><br/> \n\nNote: Be careful not to leave Forest Service Road 380 and continue towards Summitville. Forest Service Road 380  makes a bit of a hairpin turn near the old mining settlement of Summitville. This occurs about 19 miles from the US Highway 160 and Park Creek Road intersection. ",

Located at an elevation of 10,900 feet on the Arapaho Roosevelt National Forest, visitors to the campground can also enjoy hiking and fishing in the area.<br/><br/>\n \nThe Guanella Pass Scenic and Historic Byway follows an old wagon route that linked the mining towns of Georgetown and Grant, Colorado.<h2>Recreation</h2>\nVisitors can go trout fishing on the South Fork of Clear Creek. Silver Dollar Lake is nearby, but cannot be reached by car. Instead, the Silver Dollar Lake Trail leads hikers above treeline to the scenic lake.<h2>Facilities</h2>\nThe campground is split into two loops by the county road and South Clear Creek. There are 18 sites in the campground. Eleven are suitable for RV camping and seven are more suitable for tents.  Large RVs are not recommended on the byway.  Most of the sites are in the open with some tent sites located among some spruce trees. Each site has a tent pad, picnic table, fire ring and charcoal grill.   The roads through the campground are gravel.  This facility provides hand pumps with potable water, vault toilets and trash dumpsters.<h2>Natural Features</h2>\nThe Arapaho and Roosevelt National Forests and Pawnee National Grassland sit along the foothills and Rockies of Colorado. The forests and grassland cover 1.5 million acres and extend north to the Wyoming border, south to Mount Evans and west across the Continental Divide.<br/><br/>\n \nThe area includes mountains, lakes and five scenic byways, designated by Congress for their scenery, wildlife or history, including the highest road in North America. Mount Evans Road, also known as Colorado Highway 5, allows visitors to drive from 10,500' to 14,130' above sea level in just 14 miles.\n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\nVisitors enjoy touring historic Georgetown, a former mining town of about 1,000 residents. Additional ghost towns dot the region.",

        "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>\nPlatoro Cabin 1 is located downtown in the small mining town of Platoro, Colorado, at an \n\nelevation of 10,000 feet in the Rio Grande National Forest.<br/><br/> \n\nThe cabin was built in 1963 by the Rio Grande National Forest as base quarters for various \n\nForest Service Crews working in the surrounding areas until the early 1990s.<br/><br/>\n\nToday the cabin is a getaway for guests seeking relaxation and recreation in south central \n\nColorado.<br/><br/>\n\nVisitors to the area should be aware that Platoro is only occupied when snow levels allow \n\ndriving access, which is usually less than six months of the year. <h2>Recreation</h2>\nThe area around the cabin offers a variety of recreational opportunities year-round. \n\nSummertime brings great scenic driving tour opportunities in and around Platoro and \n\nSummitville.<br/><br/>\n\nAnglers have a spectacular backdrop while fishing Iron Creek or Treasure Creek. Nearby Platoro \n\nReservoir, which feeds the Conejos River, provides excellent fishing for kokanee salmon, \n\nrainbow and brown trout.<br/><br/>\n\nGreat hiking can be found around the area, as it spans both the Rio Grande and San Juan \n\nNational Forests as well as the South San Juan Wilderness.<br/><br/> \n\nBig game hunting is popular in fall, while snowmobiling, skiing and snowshoeing are popular \n\nwinter activities.  \n <h2>Facilities</h2>\nThe cabin has a combination kitchen/living room, a bedroom and a bathroom. It is furnished \n\nwith two bunkbeds, with single beds on the top and foldout double beds on the bottom, accommodating up to six people. It has a heater, stove, refrigerator and lighting, all powered by \n\npropane. The kitchen is equipped with a table and chairs and cooking gear. In the bathroom \n\nthere is a flush toilet and showers.<br/><br/>\n\nAlthough the cabin has most amenities, guests do need to provide their own food, sleeping \n\nbags, linens, towels, dish soap, matches, first aid kit, toilet paper and garbage bags. Guests \n\nare also encouraged to bring an additional light source in case of emergencies.<br/><br/>\n\nNearby Platoro Cabin #2 is similar to Platoro Cabin #1, with the addition entry ramps and \n\nwheelchair accessible facilities in the bathroom and the kitchen.<br/><br/> \n\nThe town of Platoro has access to  rental cabins, a small lodge, outfitter-guide services and \n\nhorseback rides. <h2>Natural Features</h2>\nPlatoro is a natural and unspoiled destination nestled in the San Juan Mountains of southern \n\nColorado. Platoro started out as a boomtown in the late 1800s following the discovery of \n\nlarge deposits of gold and silver in the area.<br/><br/> \n\nThe nearby San Juan Wilderness is an area defined by peaks and cliffs as well as pinnacles \n\nand ridges. The headwaters for the Conejos, San Juan and Blanco Rivers are located here \n\nas well. The erosion of rich volcanic rock in combination with heavy snowfall has produced \n\nforest ecosystems in the area that transition from lodgepole pine to aspen, then through \n\nEngelmann spruce and subalpine fir to alpine tundra.\n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\nSummitville is a nearby ghost town where gold was first discovered in 1870, then mined until \n\nthe early 1990s. When contaminants leaked off-site and flowed into the local watershed the \n\ngovernment forced it to shut down. Now a water treatment plant is on the site as part of a \n\nfederal clean up program.",
        "FacilityDirections": "From Antonito, CO, follow Highway 17 west to its junction with FSR 250.  Follow FSR 250 northwest up the Conejos Canyon about 22 miles to Platoro.  Turn left on FSR 250.6A and follow it 0.2 mile to the cabin.<br/><br/>\n\n\n\nFrom the town of South Fork, follow Highway 160 to the southwest for about 7.5 miles. \n\nTurn left onto Park Creek Road, which is also Forest Service Road 380. Continue for approximately 27 miles, paralleling Park Creek for much of the way. \n\nTurn right (south), crossing the Alamosa River, and follow National Forest Road 250 over \n\nStunner pass and into the town of Platoro. This stretch of the trip is about 6 miles long. The \n\ncabins are located on the southeast part of town. It is best to cross the Conejos River using \n\nthe lower bridge; this is National Forest Road 250.6A. Continue on this road for about .2 \n\nmiles to the cabins. The cabins are easily identified by their yellow and brown siding and \n\ntrim, as well as by the Forest Service signs.<br/><br/>\n\nNote: Be careful not to leave Forest Service Road 380 and continue towards Summitville. \n\nForest Service Road 380  makes a bit of a hairpin turn near the old mining settlement of \n\nSummitville. This occurs about 19 miles from the US Highway 160 and Park Creek Road \n\nintersection. ",

        "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>\nPeavy Cabin was built in 1934 by Dr. George Wilcox Peavy, Dean of the School of Forestry at Oregon Agricultural College (later Oregon State University). The facility was used as his outdoor laboratory to instruct forestry students. \n<br/><br/>\nThe cabin was then turned over to the Forest Service and used as a guard station. Several restoration projects have kept the integrity and charm of this historic structure, which is now recorded in the Heritage Resource Inventory as a historic site.\n<br/><br/>\nThis cabin is available from July 1 until October 31 and is accessible via an unpaved road. High clearance and 4-wheel drive vehicles are recommended. Guests must bring some of their own supplies; however, Peavy Cabin does offers few modern conveniences to make for a comfortable stay.<h2>Recreation</h2>\n<p>Peavy Trailhead is adjacent to the cabin and provides access to the North Fork John Day Wilderness via the Peavy Trail #1640 and the Cunningham Cove Trail #1643. Both trails connect with the Elkhorn Crest National Recreation Trail #1611. These trails are suitable for hikers and horseback riders.<br><br><br>The North Fork John Day River is a popular fishing spot for anglers wishing to catch smallmouth bass and steelhead.</p>\n\n<p>For questions for Anthony Lake, Grande Ronde Lake, Mud Lake, Peavey Cabin, and Anthony Lake Guard Station call <strong>(541) 856-3277 ext. 114</strong></p>\n<h2>Facilities</h2>\nThis rustic, single-room log cabin contains a fireplace with a wood stove for heating, a large table and benches, and enough beds to sleep 4. The kitchen is equipped with a gas range, refrigerator and dry sink, as well as some cooking and serving utensils. \n<br/><br/>\nThe grounds are partially fenced and include a picnic table and wood shed. Space is available for additional tent camping. A vault toilet is located near the cabin.\n<br/><br/> \nThere is no potable water on-site, and guests must bring plenty for drinking, washing and cooking. Guests are expected to bring garbage bags to pack out trash and are required to clean the cabin before leaving. \n<br/><br/>\nBedding, towels, dish soap and emergency items like flashlights and first aid kits are not provided. Phone service, fuel, and a small general store with a cafe are located approximately 15 miles away in the community of Granite.<h2>Natural Features</h2>\nThe cabin sits next to the Wild and Scenic North Fork John Day River at an elevation of 5,900 feet. The Wild and Scenic North Fork John Day River originates in the North Fork John Day Wilderness, and the Baldy Unit section of this wilderness is adjacent to the cabin. The Baldy Unit features diverse landscapes like the rolling benchlands and the granite outcrops of the Greenhorn Mountains.\n<br/><br/> \nMuch of the wilderness is composed of gentle benchlands and tablelands; the remaining of steep ridges and alpine lake basins. Dense virgin stands of conifer species like Douglas fir, white fir, western larch and lodgepole pine cover the landscape. The area also supports wildlife species like Rocky Mountain elk, mule deer, RockyMountain goats and black bears (<a href=\"http://www.fs.fed.us/outernet/r6/w-w/recreation/Visitor-safety/bears.shtml\" rel=\"nofollow\">information on bear safety</a>).\n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\nPeavy Cabin is 3 miles from the state-designated Elkhorn Scenic Byway. This 106-mile drive through the Elkhorn Mountains passes through ghost towns and features numerous lakes and rivers.<h2>Charges & Cancellations</h2>\n A $10.00 service fee will apply if you change or cancel your reservation. Late cancellations are subject to additional fees. For full details see NRRS Reservation Policy ",

        "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>\nMiner's Retreat is an old Forest Service cabin that allows guests to relax in the outdoors and also step back in time to when the cabin was used during the bygone gold mining days. Miner's Retreat is part of the Fremont Powerhouse complex, a hub for mining built in the early 1900s. It is one of four cabins located at the site near the town of Granite, and provides great flexibility for larger groups.\n<br/><br/>\nThe surrounding valleys once teemed with mining activity, primarily gold. The Fremont Powerhouse was built in 1908 as an economical method for mining. Two dams were constructed at Olive Lake, and water from the lake was piped through an 8-mile wood and steel pipeline to the powerhouse to generate electricity. Homes were constructed to shelter workers who monitored the pipeline. Today, these same shelters are where visitors can stay overnight.\n<br/><br/>\nThe cabin is uphill from the Fremont Powerhouse, flanked by Caretakers Cabin and Hilltop Hideaway. Winter access may require skis, snowshoes or snowmobiles.<br/><br/>                                    \n<a href=\"http://www.photographyoptions.net/images/usace/redrock/tour.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Click here</a> for a virtual tour of the area.<h2>Recreation</h2>\n Guests can hike on trails into the North Fork John Day Wilderness or go mountain biking on forest roads. A drive along the Blue Mountain Scenic Byway is a treat, as are other activities like huckleberry and mushroom picking, bird watching, wildlife viewing and photographing the vast landscape. Nearby Olive Lake offers boating, fishing and swimming.<h2>Facilities</h2>\nThis cozy little cabin offers a covered front porch and features two bedrooms, a full bath with hot and cold running water (during the summer months only) and a kitchen and living room. The cabin has electric lights throughout and is heated with electric wall heaters. \n<br/><br/>\nThe cabin sleeps up to six and is fully furnished with beds, a couch and a table with chairs. The kitchen is equipped with an electric stove and oven, refrigerator and a variety of utensils, such as skillets, a coffee pot, glasses, cups, dishes and silverware. Cleaning supplies are also provided. Guests must bring sleeping bags or bedding, a flashlight, first aid kit, washcloths, towels and dish soap, among other general camping supplies. <a href=\"http://www.fs.fed.us/r6/recreation/rentals/uma-miners-retreat.shtml\" rel=\"nofollow\">Click here</a> for more cabin details.<h2>Natural Features</h2>\nThe cabin sits at an elevation of about 5,000 feet, on a hillside overlooking the expansive Umatilla National Forest near the North Fork John Day Wilderness.

The cabin was also used \n\nas a Forest Service Station from 1950 until 1962, serving as living quarters for Forest Service \n\nemployees who worked on numerous projects in the area.<br/><br/>\n\nAlthough the phone line has been abandoned, today the cabin is a high-altitude getaway for \n\nguests seeking relaxation and recreation in south-central Colorado.<br/><br/> \n\nDuring summer months the cabin can \n\nbe accessed by motorized travel. During winter months access to the cabin is by \n\nsnowmobiles, cross country skiing or snow shoeing.\n<h2>Recreation</h2>\nThe area around Elwood cabin offers a variety of recreational opportunities year-round. \n\nSummertime brings excellent scenic tour opportunities in and around the Summitville area \n\nas well as exploration of several historical mining sites.<br/><br/>\n\nAnglers have a spectacular backdrop to fishing streams such as Iron Creek or Treasure Creek. \n\nNearby Platoro Reservoir, which feeds the Conejos River, provides excellent fishing for trout \n\nand salmon.<br/><br/>\n\nGreat hiking can be found around the area, as it spans both the Rio Grande and San Juan \n\nNational Forests, as well as the South San Juan Wilderness.<br/><br/> \n\nIn winter, the Elwood cabin area can be blanketed with as much as ten feet of snow, requiring \n\npreparation and knowledge of winter travel. Snowmobiling, skiing and snowshoeing are \n\npopular activities in the area. <h2>Facilities</h2>\nThe one room log cabin is furnished with two bunk beds with single beds on the top and foldout double beds on the bottom, accommodating up to six people. The cabin has a wood stove for \n\nheat, propane lighting and a propane stove.  The kitchen is equipped with a table and chairs, \ncooking utensils, pots and pans and a fire extinguisher. Firewood is available in the \n\nadjoining shed. An outdoor vault toilet is also on-site.<br/><br/> \n\nGuests must provide a sufficient supply of water for cooking, cleaning \n\nand washing. Guests are also encouraged to bring an additional light source in case of \n\nemergencies.<br/><br/>\n\nAlthough the cabin has some amenities, guests do need to provide their own food, sleeping \n\nbags, linens, towels, dish soap, matches, first aid kit, avalanche equipment, toilet paper and \n\ngarbage bags.<h2>Natural Features</h2>\nHigh in the San Juan Mountains at an elevation of 11,000 feet, this cabin provides guests with views of nearby peaks, \n\nmeadows filled with wildflowers and alpine forests.<br/><br/>\n\nWhile staying at such a high elevation guests will notice how light plays differently on the \n\nlandscape and stars blanket the sky on clear cold evenings. Elk, deer, and other wildlife are \n\noften seen in meadows adjacent to the cabin. Bear, marmot and chipmunks also call the \n\narea home.\n\n\n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\nSummitville is a nearby ghost town where gold was first discovered in 1870, then mined until \n\nthe early 1990s. When contaminants leaked off-site and flowed into the local watershed the \n\ngovernment forced it to shut down. Now a water treatment plant is on the site as part of a \n\nfederal clean up program.",
        "FacilityDirections": "From Del Norte, take U.S. Highway 160 west to South Fork. Continue west on U.S. Highway  \n\n160 for 8 miles to Park Creek Road. Travel 15 miles on Park Creek Road to Summitville \n\nRoad. Turn right on FSR 380, the cabin is about 2 miles on the left.<br/><br/>\n\nFrom the junction of  FSR 250 in the Alamosa Canyon and FSR 380, follow FSR 380 about 8 miles, the cabin is on the right.<br/><br/>\n\n\nAccess to the cabin in the summertime can be accomplished with just about any vehicle; \n\nhowever, when the dirt roads are wet they tend to get slick.<br/><br/>  \n\nIn winter, the trail access to the Elwood Cabin is on the unplowed portion of Forest Road 380, \n\nwhich starts southeast from the junction, but makes a bend and continues south-southwest to the cabin. The 2 mile ski to the cabin is generally easy with a \n\n400 foot elevation gain. The Elwood Cabin is visible below the road on a knoll projecting into a \n\nlarge open park. Allow from 1.5 - 2 hours or longer, depending on snow conditions, for the trip.",

        "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>\n<p>Chalk Lake Campground is located in beautiful Chaffee County, Colorado. This popular facility sits near Chalk Lake and is within 4 miles of a private hot springs resort, making it an ideal location for rest and relaxation.</p>\n\n<p><strong>\"First come, first served\" does not necessarily mean that the site will be available when you get there. Someone may get there before you. This is a popular campground and is normally full starting on Friday, sometimes as early as Thursday, so plan accordingly.</strong></p>\n\n<h2>Recreation</h2>\nChalk Lake is located next to the campground and is a great family fishing spot with rainbow, brook and brown trout. Motorized boats are not allowed on the lake. Chalk Creek also offers fishing, and it's best above Cascade Falls. \n  \nPlenty of off-road vehicle trails are near the campground. Recommended rides include Mount Antero, Baldwin Lake, Tincup Pass, Hancock Pass, Pomeroy Lakes, and Hancock Lakes.\n  \nThe Cascade Loop Trail is located across the street from the campground. The Chalk Creek Trailhead  is about 2 miles east of the campground which gives hikers access to the extensive Colorado Trail, which extends nearly 500 miles from Denver to Durango.<h2>Facilities</h2>\nThe campground offers single-family sites, a few of which are accessible. Each site is equipped with a picnic table and campfire ring. Accessible vault toilets are provided. Firewood is sold on-site.\n\nSites: #4-9, and 14 \"walk-up\", first-come, first-served sites. All other sites are reservable. \nSite #1 is used by the host from mid-May to mid-September. After that time it is available as a \"walk-up\", first-come, first-served site.<h2>Natural Features</h2>\nThe campground sits at an elevation of 9,000 feet in Chalk Creek Canyon, which gets its name from the soft, white, chalk-like kaolinite canyon walls. Kaolinite is a clay mineral that was deposited by percolating hot springs. A variety of wildlife makes its home in the area, including chipmunks, hummingbirds, birds of prey and mule deer.\n  \n\n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\nTake a day trip to the historic ghost town of St. Elmo, just 15 minutes from the campground. An old saloon, county courthouse and many other historic structures remain from the days of its mining glory. Rock hounds come to the area in search of quartz and aquamarine.\n  \n\n\nThe city of Salida and Town of Buena Vista are only a short drive away where visitors can enjoy distinctive restaurants, unique shops, incredible art galleries and a large selection of antique shops.  The area boasts more than 100 miles of Arkansas River to raft, fish, float or kayak in, as well as fifteen 14,000 ft mountains. Visitors can choose from recreational activities like hiking, biking, ATV/UTV riding, kayaking, rafting, fishing, horseback riding, zipping and swimming.<h2>Charges & Cancellations</h2>\n<p>Cancellations</p>\n<p>Individual Campsites: Cancellations up to 2 days before a reservation start date incur a $10.00 cancellation fee. </p>\n\n<p>A visitor who cancels a reservation the day before or on the day of arrival will pay a $10.00 service fee AND forfeit the first night's use fee including tax and applicable add-on for a campsite.</p>\n\n<p>Cancellations for a one-night reservation will forfeit the entire amount paid and will not be subject to an additional service fee.</p>\n\n<p>No-Shows</p>\n<p>A no-show visitor is one who does not arrive at a campground and does not cancel the reservation by check-out time on the day after the scheduled arrival date. Staff will hold a campsite until check-out time on the day following the arrival date.</p>\n\n<p>No-shows are assessed $20.00 service fee and forfeit the first night's rate, taxes and applicable add-on for a campsite.  </p>\n\n<p>Refunds</p>\n<p>Visitors may submit a refund request through their Recreation.gov profile within 7 days of the end date of their reservation. Refunds will not be issued after the 7 days has ended.</p>\n\n<p>Refunds for debit or credit card payments will be issued as a credit to the original bank or credit card used to pay.</p>\n\n<p>For check or cash purchases, Recreation.gov will mail a Treasury check for refunds of cash, check, or money order payments to the address associated with the reservation. Treasury check refunds may take up to 6-8 weeks to arrive. </p>\n\n<p>In the event of an emergency closure, the Recreation.gov team or facility manager will refund all fees and will attempt to notify you using the contact information within the Recreation.gov visitor profile.</p>\n\n\n",

        "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>\n<p>Mount Princeton Campground is located in beautiful Chalk Creek Canyon in central Colorado. This popular facility is within 4 miles of a private hot springs resort, making it an ideal location for rest and relaxation.</p>\n\n<p><strong>\"First come, first served\" does not necessarily mean that the site will be available when you get there. Someone may get there before you. This is a popular campground and is normally full starting on Friday, sometimes as early as Thursday, so plan accordingly.</strong></p>\n<h2>Recreation</h2>\n<p>Stream fishing is best above Cascade Falls, about 2 miles west of the campground. Nearby Chalk Lake is heralded as a great family fishing lake with rainbow, brook and brown trout.<br>  <br>Nearby ATV/UTV and 4X4 rides include Mount Antero, Baldwin Lake, Tincup Pass, Hancock Pass, Pomeroy Lakes, Hancock Lakes.</p>\n<h2>Facilities</h2>\n<p>The campground offers single-family sites, a few of which are wheelchair accessible. Each site is equipped with a picnic table and campfire ring with grill. Wheelchair accessible vault toilets are provided. Firewood is sold on-site. Parking spurs are gravel.<br><br>Sites #1, and 14-17 are \"walk-up\", first-come, first-served sites. All other sites are reservable.<br>Site #2 is used by the host from mid-May to Labor Day weekend, after that it is available as a \"walk-up\", first-come, first-served site.</p>\n<h2>Natural Features</h2>\nThe campground is situated at an elevation of 8,600 feet in Chalk Creek Canyon, which gets its name from the soft, white, chalk-like kaolinite canyon walls. Kaolinite is a clay mineral that was deposited by percolating hot springs. A stand of ponderosa pine and Douglas fir offers partial shade in the campground.   \n  \nChalk Creek can be accessed from the campground. It flows 27 miles eastward from the Collegiate Peaks before joining the Arkansas River. Chalk Lake is about a mile west of the campground.\n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\n<p>Take a day trip to the historic ghost town of St. Elmo, just 15 minutes from the campground. An old saloon, county courthouse and many other historic structures remain from the days of its mining glory. Rock hounds come to the area in search of quartz and aquamarine.<br>  <br><br><br><br>The city of Salida and Town of Buena Vista are only a short drive away where visitors can enjoy unique restaurants, shops, and art galleries. The area boasts more than 100 miles of Arkansas River to raft, fish, float or kayak, as well as fifteen 14,000 ft. mountains. Visitors can choose from recreational activities like hiking, biking, ATV/UTV riding, kayaking, rafting, fishing, horseback riding, ziplining and swimming.</p>\n<h2>Charges & Cancellations</h2>\n<p>Cancellations</p>\n<p>Individual Campsites: Cancellations up to 2 days before a reservation start date incur a $10.00 cancellation fee. </p>\n\n<p>A visitor who cancels a reservation the day before or on the day of arrival will pay a $10.00 service fee AND forfeit the first night's use fee including tax and applicable add-on for a campsite.</p>\n\n<p>Cancellations for a one-night reservation will forfeit the entire amount paid and will not be subject to an additional service fee.</p>\n\n<p>No-Shows</p>\n<p>A no-show visitor is one who does not arrive at a campground and does not cancel the reservation by check-out time on the day after the scheduled arrival date. Staff will hold a campsite until check-out time on the day following the arrival date.</p>\n\n<p>No-shows are assessed $20.00 service fee and forfeit the first night's rate, taxes and applicable add-on for a campsite.  </p>\n\n<p>Refunds</p>\n<p>Visitors may submit a refund request through their Recreation.gov profile within 7 days of the end date of their reservation. Refunds will not be issued after the 7 days has ended.</p>\n\n<p>Refunds for debit or credit card payments will be issued as a credit to the original bank or credit card used to pay.</p>\n\n<p>For check or cash purchases, Recreation.gov will mail a Treasury check for refunds of cash, check, or money order payments to the address associated with the reservation. Treasury check refunds may take up to 6-8 weeks to arrive. </p>\n\n<p>In the event of an emergency closure, the Recreation.gov team or facility manager will refund all fees and will attempt to notify you using the contact information within the Recreation.gov visitor profile.</p>\n\n\n",

The campground is located 3 miles south of Jefferson Lake, one of the highest elevation lakes around, capping 10,685 feet elevation and bordered by steep 12,000 foot peaks. \n<br/><br/>\nFishing in both the creek and lake offer promising catches of trout. Another noteworthy aspect of the campground is its access to the Colorado Trail. <h2>Recreation</h2>\nThe best hiking, biking and horseback riding experience is on the epic Colorado Trail, a 471-mile trail that extends from Denver to Durango. Also accessible from the campground is the West Jefferson Loop Trail, a foot path that extends for 11 miles and reaches the Continental Divide. \n<br/><br/>\nRainbow, brown, mackinaw and brook trout can be found swimming in the creek. For those who prefer fishing by boat, Jefferson Lake has a boat ramp. It is a no-wake lake.  <h2>Facilities</h2>\nLodgepole offers more than 30 reservable campsites. Parking aprons are gravel and dirt and the max RV length 30 feet. Amenities include picnic tables, vault toilets, drinking water and grills.  \n\n<h2>Natural Features</h2>\nLodgepole sits in a valley along Jefferson Creek facing Jefferson Hill at the high elevation of 9,900 feet. The single-loop campground is surrounded by groves of aspen and mixed conifer trees. Jefferson Lake, spanning about 182 acres, has deep, cold waters and freezes over in winter. \n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\nVisitors enjoy Fairplay, Colorado, a ghost town that was once a frontier boom town. The South Park City Museum contains 34 authentic buildings with 60,000 artifacts.\n<h2>contact_info</h2>\nFor facility specific information, please call (661) 702-1420.<h2>Charges & Cancellations</h2>\n<p>Cancellations</p>\n<p>Individual Campsites: Cancellations up to 2 days before a reservation start date incur a $10.00 cancellation fee. </p>\n\n<p>A visitor who cancels a reservation the day before or on the day of arrival will pay a $10.00 service fee AND forfeit the first night's use fee including tax and applicable add-on for a campsite.</p>\n\n<p>Cancellations for a one-night reservation will forfeit the entire amount paid and will not be subject to an additional service fee.</p>\n\n<p>No-Shows</p>\n<p>A no-show visitor is one who does not arrive at a campground and does not cancel the reservation by check-out time on the day after the scheduled arrival date.

        "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>\n<p>Hilltop Hideaway is a 1930's era cabin that allows guests to relax in the outdoors and step back in time to the bygone gold mining days. Hilltop Hideaway is part of the Fremont Powerhouse complex, a hub for mining built in the early 1900s. It is one of four cabins located at the site near the town of Granite, and provides great flexibility for larger groups. The surrounding valleys once teemed with mining activity, primarily gold. The Fremont Powerhouse was built as an economical power source for mining. Two dams were constructed at Olive Lake and the water was piped through an 8-mile wood and steel pipeline to the powerhouse to generate electricity. Homes were constructed to shelter workers who monitored the pipeline. Today, these same homes are available for the public to enjoy. Hilltop Hideaway is the cabin farthest uphill from the Fremont Powerhouse. Winter access may require skis, snowshoes or snowmobiles. Click here for a virtual tour of the area.</p>\n<h2>Recreation</h2>\n<p>Guests can hike on trails into the North Fork John Day Wilderness or go mountain biking on forest roads. A drive along the Blue Mountain Scenic Byway is a treat, as are other activities like huckleberry and mushroom picking, bird watching, wildlife viewing and photographing the vast landscape. Nearby Olive Lake offers boating, fishing and swimming.</p>\n<h2>Facilities</h2>\n<p>This cozy little cabin features one bedroom with a queen over queen bunkbed, a full bath with hot and cold running water (during the summer months only), a kitchen, and a living room. The cabin has electric lights throughout and is heated with electric heaters. The cabin sleeps up to four and is fully furnished with beds, a couch, and a table with chairs. The kitchen is equipped with an electric stove and oven, refrigerator, microwave and a variety of utensils, such as pots/skillets, a coffee pot, toaster, dishes and silverware. Cleaning supplies are also provided and renters are required to clean the house before they leave. Guests must bring sleeping bags or bedding, a flashlight, first aid kit, washcloths, towels and dish soap, among other general camping supplies. </p>\n<h2>Natural Features</h2>\n<p>The cabin sits at an elevation of about 5,000 feet, on a hillside overlooking the expansive Umatilla National Forest near the North Fork John Day Wilderness. A grassy lawn in front leads to the other three cabins in the area. The forest lies in the Blue Mountains and is home to Ponderosa pine and Douglas fir. Birds in the area include the black-backed woodpecker, American kestrel and the Boreal owl. Black bear, cougar, wolves, elk and deer are among the native land mammals.

The town provides groceries and fuel.</p>\n",

        "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>\nBig Meadows is located in the San Juan Mountains in south-central Colorado, about 11 miles west of South Fork. The campground is lightly wooded with spruce trees, creating a beautiful meadow atmosphere.\n<br/><br/>\nThe Rio Grande National Forest spans 1.86 million acres in south-central Colorado. The Continental Divide runs for 236 miles along most of the forest's western border, presenting a myriad of ecosystems from alpine desert to dense wilderness.<h2>Recreation</h2>\nAn accessible fishing pier, located on the north shore of the reservoir, allows anglers to cast for rainbow, brown and brook trout. Hunting, boating and hiking are also popular pastimes. <br/><br/>\nHikers and horseback riders will enjoy the 6-mile Archuleta Trail. The trail accesses the Weminuche Wilderness, Colorado's largest wilderness, which boasts the headwaters of dozens of major streams and rivers that feed into the Rio Grande and San Juan rivers.<h2>Facilities</h2>\nEach site has a campfire ring and picnic tables. Drinking water is available.\n<br/><br/>\nThe nearest dump station is 13 miles away, and a boat ramp is located on the north shore of the reservoir.<h2>Natural Features</h2>\nThe campground meanders up a mountainside above Big Meadows Reservoir in a series of loops. As a sub-alpine region, the campground gets more rainfall than the opposite side of the lake, resulting in plentiful wildflowers and aspens surrounding the campsites.\n<h2>contact_info</h2>\nFor facility specific information, please call (805) 434-1996.\n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\nThe surrounding area has plenty to keep visitors busy, with attractions like Great Sand Dunes National Park, Native American ruins, remnants of the Spanish Conquistadors and gold rush ghost towns. The Sangre de Cristo and San Juan Ranges are laced with trails for avid hikers.",

This high alpine campground sits at an elevation of 9,160 feet in the Lemhi Mountain Range, 22 miles from Leadore, Idaho.<h2>Recreation</h2>\n<p>There's no lack of recreational opportunities around Meadow Lake Campground. The lake is stocked twice a year so the fish are always biting. Fish from the bank or carry your boat down to the lake and try from the water, as there is no boat ramp or boat dock at the lake.<br><br><br>Hiking opportunities are available right out of the campground and include trail # 342 which provides a gentle loop around the backside of the campground. Try trail # 057 which takes you up to the steep ridge above the campground (the trail to Meadow Lake Peak is not maintained by the Forest Service). <br><br><br>If a slower pace is appealing, pull up a chair and soak-up the incredible views from the campground.  <br></p>\n<h2>Facilities</h2>\nMeadow Lake Campground consists of 17 campsites and a day use area with picnic tables, fire rings and barbecue pedestals. The campground offers 2 vault toilets, drinking water and day use parking. 4 double campsites are available for larger groups with each site including 2 picnic tables, 2 tent pads, a campfire ring, a prep table, and expanded parking for 2 vehicles.

Jerry and Helen Walker purchased the cabin in 1967, then donated it to the U.S. Forest Service in the 1980s. It is now available for public recreational use. The cabin must be reserved in advanced; there are no walk-ups.<br><br></p>\n<h2>Recreation</h2>\nCrooked River is a popular area for many recreational opportunities, including hiking, trout fishing, hunting, snowmobiling and cross-country skiing. A nice hiking trail\nis located behind the cabin.<br/><br/> \n\nNearby trails lead to the Orogrande Summit, Buffalo Hump and Gospel Hump. Snowshoes may be required on the trails in winter. There are several lakes within a 3-mile \nradius that are easily accessible by foot or off-road vehicle.<h2>Facilities</h2>\nThe rustic cabin has two bedrooms with two single beds each, a living room with a wood insert in the fireplace, several chairs, a table, a broom\nand a kitchen with a wood cook stove. A vault toilet is located in a separate building. Guests can find firewood in a shed behind the cabin.<br/><br/>  \n\nRunning water and electricity are not available.

Its life as a town began with the construction of a railroad in 1881, and it soon became an important depot as well as the closest railroad stop to Tombstone, then one of the largest western cities (15,000 in 1882). Originally called Junction City, Kendall, then Fairbanks, it was officially named Fairbank on May 16, 1883. The name refers to N.K. Fairbank of Chicago, who helped finance the railroad. The town, was built on an old Mexican land grant, the San Juan de las Boquillas y Nogales, which was bought by the Boquillas Land and Cattle Company in 1901. The company evicted all potential land owners, but continued to lease the mercantile building and a few residences well into the 1970's. The Bureau of Land Management acquired the land that was once the Mexican Land Grant in 1986 as part of the San Pedro Riparian NCA. Today the area is open for the public to enjoy. Take a self-guided tour around what was once a thriving boom-town of the wild west! Be on the look-out for historic points of interest . . .

        "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>\n<p>Assateague Island National Seashore is a 37-mile long barrier island on the Atlantic Coast of Maryland and Virginia.  Famed for its wild horses, this barrier island is a constantly shifting ribbon of sand, altered daily by powerful wind and waves.  Assateague Island, dedicated as a National Seashore on September 1, 1965, lays claim to a long and rich history.  Today's visitors can explore sandy beaches, salt marshes, maritime forests, and coastal bays.  Only a couple of miles wide at its broadest point, the island's terrain offers shelter to the famed wild horses as well as sika deer, ghost crabs, and migrating birds such as the great blue heron and snowy egret.  Favorite recreational activites include fishing, surfing, beachcombing, swimming, and sunbathing. </p>\n<p>The Over-Sand Vehicle (OSV) Zone at Assateague Island contains miles of unspoiled beaches managed by the National Park Service to accommodate OSV enthusiasts and other beach goers.<br> <br>The Assateague Island National Seashore, Assateague State Park, and the Chincoteague National Wildlife Refuge work together to manage and protect this unique, diverse strip of land. <br> <br>For more information visit the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/asis/index.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Assateague Island National Seashore website</a> . </p>\n<h2>Recreation</h2>\n<p>Activities are abundant on the island, with both crabbing and clamming as well as a long stretch of beach for swimming, kayaking and fishing.</p>\n<h2>Facilities</h2>\n<p>The campground is open year-round. Advance reservations are available up to 6 months in advance during the following dates: </p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Oceanside Group sites</strong>: Year-round.</li>\n<li><strong>Bayside Individual sites</strong>: Year-round.</li>\n<li><strong>Equestrian Non-electric sites</strong>: From October 16 through April 15 each year (closed April 16 - October 15).</li>\n<li><strong>Oceanside Individual sites</strong>: From March 15 through November 15 each year (first come first serve only, November 16 - March 14). </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Amenities include vault toilets, drinking water, and unheated showers (March 15 - November 15 only) for rinsing off sand. Water in the campground is available when temperatures are above freezing, and year round at the dump stations.</p>\n<p>The island can be accessed from the northern route in Maryland or the southern route in Virginia, but there is no through road from one end of the island to the other. Access to both Maryland and Virginia entrances are reached by bridge over mainland routes. </p>\n<h2>Natural Features</h2>\n<p>Assateague Island, famed for its wild horses, lies off the Delmarva Peninsula on the Atlantic Coast. This barrier island is a constantly shifting ribbon of sand, altered daily by powerful wind and waves. <br> <br>The Assateague Island National Seashore, Assateague State Park, and the Chincoteague National Wildlife Refuge each manage and protect this unique, diverse strip of land. <br> <br>For more information visit the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/asis/index.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Assateague Island National Seashore website</a> . </p>\n\n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.fws.gov/refuge/chincoteague/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Chincoteague National Wildlife Refuge</a>  offers a 14,000-acre wildlife preserve located at the southern end of Assateague Island. To the north, <a href=\"https://dnr.maryland.gov/publiclands/pages/eastern/assateague.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">Assateague State Park </a> features two miles of pristine ocean beaches. Ocean City, Maryland is only about 10 miles away with a 2.5 mile long boardwalk filled with shops, restaurants, and a wide variety of entertainment options. The historic town of Berlin is about 10 miles west of Assateague, offering many shops and restaurants. </p>\n<h2>Charges & Cancellations</h2>\n<p>Cancellations/Modifications: Customers can modify/cancel reservations starting 18 days after the reservation was made. Customers cancelling a reservation will be charged a $10.00 service fee. Customers wishing to modify a reservation can do so online or over the phone with Recreation.gov and may be subject to a $10.00 service fee. </p>\n<p>Late Cancellations: Customers who cancel a reservation the day before or the day of arrival will pay a $10.00 service fee and forfeit the first night’s use fee. Cancellations for a 1-night stay will forfeit the entire amount paid and will not be subject to the additional service fee. </p>\n<p>Early Departures: Customers wishing to early depart before 11am can receive a refund for that night and subsequent nights provided they are off the campsite completely by 11am.

        "FacilityDescription": "Mining in the Swansea Area began around 1862, but major activity had to wait for the coming of the railroad.  In 1904 the Arizona & California Railroad began constructing a line from Wickenburg to Parker. Seeing an opportunity for further development several of the original miners, Newton Evans and Thomas Jefferson Carrigan, secured investment money and began to develop Swansea. By the end of 1908, a 350 ton capacity furnace, a 3.5 mile water pipeline from the Bill Williams River, and the hoists for five mine shafts were under construction. By 1909 Swansea had a population of 500. The following year the Arizona & Swansea railroad began operation from Bouse. The railroad was key in moving supplies and people in and out of the growing mining town. Financial problems set in by 1911 and the mines shutdown with a brief reopening in 1912. The American Smelting and Refining Company bought the mines in 1914 and rebuilt much of the town. The new owners ran the mines until 1937 when the Great Depression closed the mines for good.<br/><br/>Little remains in the town from the glory days of Swansea. The townsite has suffered from the weather and vandalism in recent years. Several adobe and brick buildings, the railroad grade, numerous foundations, and the mine shafts remain.<br/><br/><b>The open mine shafts and tunnels are dangerous and should be avoided. Please do not take any of the historic artifacts.</b> From rusty cans and weathered wood to bricks--these all tell the story of Swansea.",
        "FacilityDirections": "<p>Swansea can be accessed by vehicle from Parker or Bouse.  The trip is about 25 miles either way and the graded gravel road gets a little rough for the last few miles.  A high clearance vehicle is recommended, but four-wheel drive is not necessary.</p><p>From Bouse take the main road east through town.  It bends north and turns to gravel just outside of town.  Stay left at the first major \"Y\" about three miles from Bouse.</p><p>Look carefully and you will see remnants of the Swansea railroad grade by the road.  You will cross the Central Arizona Project canal and about five miles beyond that come to another \"Y\" with a bulletin board.  This is called Midway, as it was halfway from Bouse to Swansea on the railroad.  Stay left at Midway and travel about 10 miles more until you reach a four way stop.  Turn right (east) and follow this road into Swansea.</p><p>From Parker head south crossing the railroad tracks just outside of town.  About a quarter mile further south is Shea Road on the left (east).  Turn here and follow the paved road for about 13 miles turning south onto a dirt road marked by a county sign pointing to Swansea.  Continue straight at the four way stop until you reach Swansea.</p>",

The ghost town of Stunner is just east of the campground. This was a mining town that failed due to nonproducing mines and transportation problems. Parts of the town are private property, so pack out all your trash and observe posted trespassing signs.  Stunner Campground is beside the Alamosa River 2 miles below the top of Stunner Pass. There are 10 campsites with tables, fireplaces, vault type toilet, ample parking and a developed water system operated with a hand pump. Firewood is limited. Convenient trailer spaces available. The Alamosa River is nearby for fishing, unfortunately, naturally acidic water severely limits fishing in the Alamosa River between Stunner Campground and Terrace Reservoir. Big game hunting is possible. Stunner is a ghost town of historic significance. Please pack your trash. Obtain permission before entering any private property in the area.  Stunner, never very big, has long been a ghost town with ghost mines on both sides of the Alamosa. The names of its mines have a special flavor -- the Orpheus, Cornucopia, the Merrimac, Log Cabin, and Snow Storm, and as always, a mine named for a wife, daughter or sweetheart, the Louise. Only those mines north of the river shipped payable ore; those south, shipped no ore. Stunner, like the Platoro camp south across the mountain to the left, had transportation problems. The government road had washed out by 1885 and was not repaired because of the discontinuance of the forts at Fort Garland and at Pagosa Springs, and the construction of a railroad over Cumbres Pass to the south. This meant mail was delivered by pack trains and post riders in the summer and on skis in the winter.  The ink-blue, fringed gentians bloom in the meadow in late August. One of the nation's earlier transcontinental telephone lines passed here, built about 1910. The Telephone Cabins sheltered the heroic m",

        "FacilityDescription": "<p>Galena Lodge is a winter and summer resort located in Idaho's Sawtooth National Recreation Area. Galena can thank a rich history of mining, sheep herding and logging for much of its trail system. Galena has a colorful history dating back to the late 1870's when the first mining claims were made in the area. The name \"Galena\" refers to basic ore, largely made of lead mixed with silver, found here in the Senate and Gladiator mines. In 1879, Galena was a thriving community of 700 people; by 1890, it was a ghost town. During summer, the lodge offers mountain biking and hiking, dining, a full-service outdoor and rental shop, guided tours and bike lessons. Winter brings to the lodge nordic skiing, snowshoeing, dining, yurt rentals, and more. Galena has become a destination for cross country skiers seeking the beauty of the Boulder mountains, open meadows, challenging hills and powder slopes. Described by Snow Country as \"arguably the best cross country ski trail sysem in the United States,\" the North Valley Trails was created in 1992 by the Blaine County Recreation District with help from a dedicated group of volunteers committed to quality, affordable skiing in the northern Wood River Valley. The North Valley Trails system is 100 kilometers of groomed ski trails stretching for over 20 miles between Ketchum and Galena Lodge. Trails are groomed for both skating and classic skiing with 36 kilometers open to doggies with their owners. There are also several trails just for snowshoers.</p>",

Named sometime during themining rush, the exact date of naming for this mountain remains unknown. It is located in the<a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/psicc/recarea/?recid=80755\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Collegiate Peaks Wilderness</a>.</p><p><br/>The Collegiate Peaks Wilderness was established in 1980 to preserve its quality, character, and integrity.  It is intended as a place where the imprint of humans is substantially unnoticed; where natural processes are the primary influences and human activity is limited to primitive recreation and minimum tools.  This will allow us, and future generations, to experience the Collegiate Peaks Wilderness in its natural condition.<br/> <br/><strong>Missouri Gulch Route (Missouri only) 5.4 miles (one way) 10.8 miles (roundtrip), 4,500 feet</strong><br/>From Leadville, travel south on US 24 to Clear Creek Reservoir Rd (Chaffee Co Rd 390).  Travel west on County Road  390 for 8 miles to the <a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/psicc/recreation/climbing/recarea/?recid=12496&actid=38\" rel=\"nofollow\">Missouri Gulch </a>Trailhead on the south side of the road near the ghost town of Vicksburg. Park here and cross a footbridge to the south side of the parking lot.</p><p><br/>From the trailhead, follow the Missouri Gulch Trail for two miles. The first two miles are very steep and many people choose to camp overnight near the old cabin just below treeline at 11,300 feet. Once in the Missouri Gulch Basin, you will pass the turnoff for <a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/psicc/recreation/hiking/recarea/?recid=81975&actid=50\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mt.

When the trail turns east towards Elkhead Pass, leave the trail and climb west up the grass slopes to a 13,700 foot saddle on Missouri’s northwest ridge. Continue up Missouri’s northwest ridge, and over a false summit (Point 13,930) to the summit.</p><p><br/>NOTE: These mountains are home to several rare and sensitive plant species.

        "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>\nHalf Moon Ranch is a ranch style house located in East Cochise Stronghold in the Dragoon Mountains of the Coronado National Forest, approximately 1-1/2 hours east of Tucson. The house is situated in a dramatic canyon that provides excellent rock climbing, hiking, mountain biking, and horseback riding opportunities. <h2>Recreation</h2>\nThe area around Half Moon ranch has long been considered a bouldering and rock climbing paradise, boasting backcountry and protected routes ranging from one to seven pitches in length, and from 5.6 to 5.12 in difficulty. Most approaches are 30-60 minutes in length, although there are a number of known areas that are easily accessible from the roads. In addition, the nearby Cochise Stronghold Campground has interpretive tales for both natural and cultural resources and history.\n  \n<h2>Facilities</h2>\n<p>Half Moon Ranch is a seven-room ranch style house, suitable for groups of up to 10 people. The house has two bedrooms, two full bathrooms, a living room, a dining room and a  kitchen. The master bedroom has a queen-size bed; the second bedroom has two beds, a twin and full. The living room contains two double futons, rocking chairs, and a wood stove (firewood not provided). The dining room has a table and chairs that seats six.   <br><br>A small dinette set with seating for four is located in the kitchen. The kitchen is equipped with a stove, oven, microwave and refrigerator, pots, pans, utensils, dishes, & coffee machine. The house has electricity and running water. Outside, guests will enjoy using picnic table for outdoor dining. The Forest Service is unable to provide firewood at this time. Please note that the indoor fireplace is not maintained for use.<br> <br>Although the cabin has amenities for comfortable lodging, guests do need to provide some of their own supplies, including food, sleeping bags, linens, pillows, towels, dish soap, matches, a first aid kit, toilet paper and garbage bags. Although electricity is available, it is recommended that guests bring an additional light source in case of emergencies. <br> <br>A barn and corrals are located to the east of the main house. There is a covered storage area for hay as well. Up to six horses/mules are permitted in the corrals, and feed must be certified weed-free.</p>\n<h2>Natural Features</h2>\nHalf Moon Ranch is surrounded by the rugged beauty of the Dragoon Mountains and Cochise Stronghold. At an elevation of 5,000 feet, the sparsely wooded area is a protective rampart of granite spires, sheer cliffs, and balanced rocks and boulders which were once the refuge of the Apache Chief, Cochise. The ranch house lies in a mountain range or \"sky island\" in the Coronado National Forest, rising dramatically from the desert floor and supporting abundant and biologically diverse plant and animal communities. \n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\nThe Half Moon Ranch is located approximately 9 miles west of Sunsites, Arizona. Attractions in the area include the Chiricahua National Monument, Fort Bowie National Historic Site, the Amerind Foundation, the ghost towns of Gleeson, Dos Cabezas,  and Courtland, and the Willcox Playa.",

        "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>\nAntlers Guard Station was built in 1935 for the fire crews who patrolled Wallowa-Whitman National Forest. The Forest Roads were not yet well developed, and it was impractical for crews to travel daily between the remote parts of the forest and the ranger station. The Civilian Conservation Corps built this structure to allow crews to stay where they worked. Antlers Guard Station was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1991.\n<br/><br/>\nGuests who stay at Antlers Guard Station can still get away from it all while enjoying the basic comforts of home. The cabin is accessible by car.<h2>Recreation</h2>\nThis cabin is popular with rock hounds, botanists, hikers, mountain bikers, hunters, and ATV riders. Anglers can fish for trout in the North Fork Burnt River.<h2>Facilities</h2>\nAntlers Guard Station is a cozy, rustic cabin with 2 small rooms. The combined living room and bedroom is furnished with a double futon and 2 sets of bunk beds that sleep 6 people comfortably. The kitchen has a table and chairs, a propane range and refrigerator, and utensils for cooking and eating. <br/><br/>\nA propane fireplace for heating and propane lights are provided. An outhouse and garage are located near the cabin. Water is available from an outside hand pump, and there is a fire ring and picnic tables for outdoor dining.\n<br/><br/>\nGuests are required to bring garbage bags to pack out their trash, and they are expected to clean the guard station before leaving. Bedding, towels and emergency items like flashlights and first aid kits are not provided.<h2>Natural Features</h2>\nAntlers Guard Station sits at an elevation of 4,107 feet on the west bank of the scenic North Fork of the Burnt River. The surrounding forest is ponderosa pine. <br/><br/>\nRattlesnakes, mountain lions and black bears inhabit this area (<a href=\"http://www.fs.fed.us/outernet/r6/w-w/recreation/Visitor-safety/bears.shtml\" rel=\"nofollow\">information\non bear safety</a>).\n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\nThe town of Whitney is 2 miles from Antlers Guard Station. This ghost town, once the home of railway and sawmill workers, fell into decline around 1918. Several long-abandoned buildings are still standing.\n<h2>contact_info</h2>\nFor facility specific information, please call (541) 894-2332.<h2>Charges & Cancellations</h2>\n A $10.00 service fee will apply if you change or cancel your reservation. Late cancellations are subject to additional fees. For full details see NRRS Reservation Policy ",

        "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>\n  \nCaretaker's Cabin allows guests to relax in the outdoors at the historic Fremont Powerhouse site.  As one of four cabins located at the site, the cabin offers flexibility for large groups, like weddings or reunions. Guests can rent all cabins (see Congo Gulch, Hilltop Hideaway, and Miner's Retreat) and also pitch tents in the grassy yard. Caretaker’s Cabin sits on a hill beside Miner’s Retreat and has parking access beside it. The cabin can accommodate up to 10 guests. Winter access may require skis, snowshoes or snowmobiles. \nIn the 1800s, the North Fork John Day drainage was bustling with gold and silver mining.  Around 1903, local mines began to notice a decline in earnings and promoted construction of a cheaper power source in an effort to operate the mines more economically.  As a result, the Fremont Powerhouse was constructed and began operation in 1908. Two dams were constructed at Olive Lake and water from the lake was piped through an eight-mile-long wood and steel pipeline to the powerhouse to generate the much-needed electrical power. The Caretaker’s Cabin house was constructed in the 1930s to shelter workers who monitored the pipeline for leaks and kept the powerhouse operating.  The entire site and pipeline are listed as an historic district on the National Register of Historic Places. <h2>Recreation</h2>\n Guests can hike on North Fork John Day Wilderness trails or go mountain biking on forest roads. A drive along the Blue Mountain Scenic Byway is a treat, as are activities like huckleberry and mushroom picking, bird watching, wildlife viewing and photographing the vast landscape. Nearby Olive Lake offers boating, fishing and swimming.<h2>Facilities</h2>\n  \nThe cabin is a 2-story house with wood siding and a shake shingle roof that can accommodate 10 guests. The cabin features: \n· two bedrooms upstairs with dressers, 2 twin beds, and 2 full-over-queen bunkbeds; \n· parlor with 2 futons and end tables; \n· dining room with a table and chairs to seat 10; \n· kitchen with refrigerator, electric stove/oven, microwave, coffee pot, toaster, cookware, and dishes; \n· bathroom with flush toilet and claw-footed tub (no shower).  \nOutside there is a fire ring and picnic table--prior to arrival please contact the District office to determine whether fires have been banned. The cabin has electric lights and electric wall heaters. Cleaning supplies are also provided and renters are required to clean the house before they leave.\nWater is available June through September only. No water or indoor plumbing from October to May. Instead, an outhouse is available for use. In these seasons, guests are asked to bring plenty of water for drinking, cooking and washing. Other items to pack year-round include food, bedding, a first aid kit, flashlight, matches and all other basic camping gear. Click here for more cabin details.<h2>Natural Features</h2>\nPerched on a small rise at about 5,000 feet in elevation, the cabin is set on a hillside under a large spruce tree. A grassy lawn in front spreads to the three other cabins in the area. The forest lies in the Blue Mountains and is home to Ponderosa pine, lodgepole pine, larch and Douglas-fir. \n \nBirds in the area include the black-backed woodpecker, American kestrel and the boreal owl. Black bear, cougar, wolves, elk and deer are among the native land mammals. Click here to learn about bear safety.\n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\nThe cabin is located less than 6 miles from Granite, Oregon, a ghost town that once bustled with prospectors and pioneers. The town provides groceries and fuel. Opportunities for horseback riding are within 10 miles of the cabin.",

        "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>\nAdams Ranger Station Cabin is located in the heart of the Nez Perce National Forest at an elevation of 5,150 feet. Adams Camp served as a way station along the Milner Trail as early as 1862. The Forest Service established the area adjacent to Adams Camp as an administrative site in 1919. Adams Ranger Station was built in 1932 for the District Ranger and his family. It last served as District headquarters in 1958. Since \nthen, it has served as a work center, hosting a variety of summer crews.<br/><br/>\n\nThe historic cabin is available for rent year-round, except during spring melt, which typically occurs from mid-March to late May. Winter access is approximately 30 miles from Fish Creek Snow Park along a groomed snowmobile route. The cabin must be reserved in advanced; there are no walk-ups.<h2>Recreation</h2>\nMany fun activities surround Adams Ranger Station, including numerous trails. Corral Creek, a nearby stock facility and trailhead, can accommodate horses\nand hikers. This trail system leads into the beautiful Gospel-Hump Wilderness.<br/><br/> \n\nThe Milner Trail, Road #641, is open to off-road vehicles in the summer and snowmobiles in the winter.<h2>Facilities</h2>\nThe cabin can accommodate up to eight people and has one futon, one double bed, two single beds and two cots. Bedding and blankets are not provided. There is a vault toilet, a propane cook stove (the oven part of the stove is not hooked up to the propane and does not work), dishes, silverware, cookware, bakeware, a table and chairs. Other amenities include propane lanterns, a broom, bucket, mop, snow shovels, axes, mauls and firewood rounds. Firewood rounds provided are for heating the cabin, not for campfires in the fire ring outside. You must provide your own firewood for the outside fire ring.<br/><br/>  \n\nWater is not available on-site. Guests must bring their own or melt snow in the winter. It is recommended that visitors bring flashlights, extra batteries, matches, \nlighters, garbage bags, candles, lantern mantles, newspapers for lighting fires, warm clothes, rain gear, boots, white gas and small propane canisters, first aid kit, \ncabin shoes or slippers, maps of Nez Perce National Forest and the Gospel Hump Wilderness and lock combinations. Sleeping bags (0 to 20 degrees) may also be needed. <a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/fsm91_055090.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Click here</a> for more cabin details.<h2>Natural Features</h2>\nAdams Ranger Station is near the Gospel-Hump Wilderness and part of the Salmon River/Highway 95 Corridor. The landscape in this corridor varies from the emerald Salmon \nRiver pouring through steep canyon walls to sapphire Moore's Lake in the remote Gospel-Hump Wilderness.<br/><br/>\n\nThe Gospel-Hump Wilderness has elevations ranging from 1,970 feet at the Wind River pack bridge on the Salmon River to 8,940 feet at the summit of Buffalo Hump. The northern part of the Wilderness is wetter and heavily forested; the southern part is dry and sparsely vegetated. The two parts are separated by a rugged, glaciated divide which contains the peaks for which the wilderness is named.<br/><br/>\n\nWildlife in the area includes mountain lions, moose, bighorn sheep, mountain goats and wolves.\n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\nGuests may wish to visit the historic gold-mining town of Florence. It is now a ghost town with a cemetery and a few long abandoned buildings.",
        "FacilityDirections": "There are two ways to access this cabin in the summer:<br/><br/>\n\n1) From the town of Grangeville, turn south on the Grangeville-Salmon Road and follow the signs toward Gospel Hump and Salmon River. At mile marker 29, turn left (east) onto Hungry Ridge Road #309 and drive approximately 1 mile. Turn left at the signs for Adams Ranger Station/Wilson Cow Camp and climb the small hill toward the cabin with a front and side porch.<br/><br/>\n\n2) From Highway 14, at mile marker 17 on Highway 14, turn west up Hungry Ridge Road and look for the Adams Ranger Station and Wilson Cow Camp signs.<br/><br/>\n\nIn winter, park at Fish Creek Snow Park and snowmobile Forest Road 221 all the way to Four Corners following the signs leading south toward the Salmon River and Gospel Hump Wilderness. Just before mile marker 29, turn left onto Hungry Ridge Road #309 and head east for approximately 1 mile. The route should be groomed all the way up to the cabin.",

        "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>\n<p>Mill Creek Campground is located 14 miles southwest of Lake City, Colorado at 9,500 feet above sea level. Nestled along the Lake Fork of the Gunnison River, the campground offers a fishing access trail for anglers and river access (though boating is not recommended from this location). The campground is surrounded by the Redcloud Peak and Handies Peak Wilderness Study Areas with world class hiking opportunities just a short drive away, including trails to three 14,000-foot peaks. From the campground, licensed OHV's and high clearance 4-wheel-drive vehicles can access the legendary Alpine Loop Backcountry Byway; a rugged 65 mile road system that connects the towns of Lake City, Silverton, and Ouray through the spectacular mountain scenery of the San Juan Mountains. The campground is accessible June through September.  </p>\n<h2>Recreation</h2>\n<p>Mill Creek Campground is an ideal base camp for exploring the Alpine Loop Backcountry Byway and the majestic San Juan Mountains. Whether you like to ride an off-highway vehicle, fly fish the Lake Fork, learn about the area's hardrock mining history, or challenge yourself to hike one of the 14,000-foot peaks, this area has something for everyone. There are also opportunities for viewing wildlife, seasonal wildflowers, and fishing the Lake Fork of the Gunnison River or nearby Lake San Cristobal.</p>\n<h2>Facilities</h2>\n<p>Mill Creek Campground has 22 campsites suitable for tent camping and medium sized RV's. Each campsite is limited to eight people and two vehicles. Each campsite features a metal fire ring with a cooking grate, a picnic table, and a bear-proof food storage box. Mill Creek Campground has vault restrooms, hand pumps for potable water, and bear-proof trash dumpsters on site.  No electric or hookups are available at Mill Creek Campground. Campground hosts are available from June through early September. </p>\n<h2>Natural Features</h2>\n<p>Mill Creek offers shaded campsites among a mixed spruce/fir and aspen forest with magnificent mountain views of some of the highest peaks in Colorado and the sounds of the nearby Mill Creek and the Lake Fork of the Gunnison River.</p>\n\n<h2>contact_info</h2>\nFor facility specific information, please call (970) 642-4940.\n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\n<p>Enjoy Lake City, nestled in the valley of the Lake Fork of the Gunnison River and Henson Creek, not only for shopping but to take in the impressive Hinsdale County Museum that celebrates the residents of past and present and tells of the rich railway history of the rail line that went to Lake City from 1889 to 1933.  A variety of tours are also available including learning about the momental volcano that formed Lake City.   </p>\n<p>Lake City also is a Gateway Community for hiking the Continental Divide Trail (CDT) that traverses 800 miles of majestic and challenging peaks dotted with abandoned homesteads, ghost towns, and remnants of Native Americans and settlers who flocked here to mine gold and silver.  Other shorter hikes from town can lead to some wonderful waterfalls. </p>\n<p>Discover Lake San Cristobal, the second largest natural lake in Colorado that was formed by the Slumgullion Earthflow that slid 700 years ago, damming the Lake Fork of the Gunnison.  The lake offers a wide variety of recreation opportunities including boating and fishing and much more.</p>\n",

        "FacilityDescription": "Animas Forks is located on a system of roads known as the Alpine Loop. The loop is a 65-mile (105 km) system of unpaved roads which connects the small mountain towns of Lake City, Ouray, and Silverton. Most of the land in the area is managed by either the U.S. Forest Service or the Bureau of Land Management. The Alpine Loop is visited by over 100,000 people each year. Animas .Forks, at an elevation of 11,200 feet (3,400 m), is more than two miles (3 km) above sea level.\n\nThe unimproved road from Silverton to Animas Forks is passable in summer by two-wheel drive vehicles. The road beyond Animas Forks over Engineer Pass to Lake City may require four-wheel drive. The town's first log cabin was built in 1873 and by 1876 the community had become a bustling mining community. At that time the town contained 30 cabins, a hotel, a general store, a saloon, and a post office. By 1883 450 people lived in Animas Forks and in 1882 a newspaper, the Animas Forks Pioneer, began publication and lasted until October 1886. Every fall the residents of Animas Forks migrated en masse to the warmer town of Silverton. In 1884 a 23-day blizzard inundated the town with 25 feet (7.6 m) of snow, the residents had to dig tunnels to get from building to building. Mining, speculation and processing mills helped Animas Forks grow.When mining profits began to decline investment in Animas Forks was no longer justified. Although mining made a brief 1904 rebound with the construction of the Gold Prince Mill the town's mining days were nearing an end. A rail line ran through the area and stimulated interest in mining in the community again but the railroad never reached its expectations. The Gold Prince Mill closed in 1910 and in 1917 most of the mill's major parts were removed for a new facility in Eureka. The mill's dismantling signaled the beginning of the end for Animas Forks. The town was a ghost town by the 1920s.When mining profits began to decline investment in Animas Forks was no longer justified.

        "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>This site marks part of the historic Dominguez-Escalante expedition. Fathers Francisco Dominguez and Silvestre Escalante, Spanish priests, may have been the first Europeans to see the Arizona Strip on their expedition in 1776. They camped here, at the San Bartoleme Camp, in October 1776. On foot, they traveled from Santa Fe, New Mexico through western Colorado, to Spanish Fork, Utah and then down through northern Arizona back to Santa Fe. Others crossed the Strip along the Old Spanish Trail during the 1830's and 1840's.<br/><br/>Opened as a trade route between Santa Fe and Los Angeles, the Spanish Trail became a major link connecting New Mexico and southern California from 1829 to 1848. It consisted of a 1,120-mile northward-looping course traversing six states--New Mexico, Colorado, Utah, Arizona, Nevada, and California. Hostile Indian tribes--Apache, Navajo, and Mojave--prevented the opening of a direct route between Santa Fe and Los Angeles.<br/><br/>Mining activities, timber cutting and settlement by farmers and ranchers began by the 1870's. Settlements founded by these pioneers lasted long enough for a post office and general store to be built at Wolfhole, and one-room schoolhouses at Little Tanks and Mount Trumbull. In the days of horse-drawn wagons, trips to town (St. George, Utah) from these communities took more than one day each way. Travelers would store feed for their stock on flat-topped boulders along the route. Later, the Civilian Conservation Corps created or improved many of the access roads and other structures. As the availability and use of motorized vehicles increased, populations of the little settlements dwindled. The communities of Mt. Trumbull, Wolf Hole and Little Tanks are now ghost towns.<br/><br/>Traveling across the Strip today, it is not so difficult to imagine the earlier times and modes of transportation: horse, wagon and Model T. Place names like Poverty Mountain, Hungry Valley, Last Chance Spring, Death Valley and Tombstone Canyon still attest to the rough life of the pioneers. <br/><br/>",
